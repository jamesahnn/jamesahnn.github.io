        Tugolo allows travelers to easily find, customize and book their trip, provided
        entirely by a local. That local is also there to rely on from the time you arrive

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      A new generation of Travelers are no longer interested in standard vacations. Instead, they
      want to get away from crowded areas to experience the real, authentic culture of the places
      they visit while seeing and doing things that only locals know about. However, travellers
      spend more time trying to book their trip than they will actually spend on vacation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Locals all across the globe can and want to provide the exact travel experiences that travelers are
      looking for. But the travelers and locals can’t find each other in a trusted way, and
      locals don't have the required tools to bring their trips to life and facilitate the
      transactions, and the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #444444;font-size: 25px;font-weight: 100;">How can I connect these travelers with locals and help them experience real and authentic
      cultures?</span>

  <div class="Solution">
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
      In order for travellers to connect with locals, the landing page had to showcase a variety of them and the
      possible services that they provide. The point of the landing page was to introduce travellers to locals
      rather than the experiences and accommodations.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="table2">
  <div class="container">

    <div class="prototype">
      <h2>Prototype 1</h2>
      <video width="100%" controls>
        <source src="prototype1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
      </video>
      <p>
        Prototype 1 was based off of the original landing page with new features
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with this prototype was that it was advertised towards showcasing locations of the
        possible experiences
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="prototype">
      <h2>Prototype 2</h2>
      <video width="100%" controls>
        <source src="prototype2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
      </video>
      <p>
        Decided to make the landing page that was unique and different.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with this prototype was it still didn’t satisfy Tugolo’s goal of connecting travellers to
        locals 
      </p>
    </div>

  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="landing">
    <h2>Landing Page Process</h2>
    <p>
      For the landing page to match the criteria for the business, it had to be re-designed such that it
      advertised the locals so travellers can easily connect with them.
    </p>
    <img src="Tugolo_wireframe.png" alt="wireframe" class ="wireframe" style="width:65%">
    <p>
      First, the landing page needed to provide a quick access to the local’s profile and their offerings. The
      first wireframe presented the top friends of Tugolo but after some user testing, it was proven that it
      wasn’t enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second wireframe had a new addition called the best friends list. This allowed the landing page to
      not only provide its top friends but also its best friends for the traveller. With some user testing, it
      proved that it will grasp people’s attention more and will spend an extra couple seconds browsing it.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class="table2">
    <h2>Partner Registration Form</h2>
    <p>
      For Tugolo’s partners to register themselves, a simple interface is designed out for them to choose what
      kind of partner they want to be. After, it asks for their information and with the use of the horizontal
      scrolling menu, the partners can easily update it.
    </p>
    <div class="container">
        <img src="./registration.png" alt="mockup" class="registration" style="width:40%">
      <div class="info">
          Once the partner chooses what category they fall into, it will ask for their personal information. Each
          page of information will slide up, following a new page of information. As a new page comes up,
          the horizontal scrolling menu slides accordingly.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="send_out">
    <h2>Provider/Friend Send Out Forms</h2>
    <p>
      Tugolo’s partners have many providers and friends and to bring those friends into the partner’s personal
      connections, a send out form was designed that presents two options; option 1 allows partners to send
      out the registration form to their providers and friends and option 2 allows partners to fill the registration
      form for them.
    </p>
    <img src="send_out.png" alt="mockup" class ="send_out" style="width:65%">
  </div>

  <div class="create">
    <h2>Create Pages</h2>
    <p>
      It is very important for partners to upload their offerings accurately. They need to list their experiences,
      accommodations, packages, and services. The amount of information needed for them to complete
      just one listing is substantial. To make it as effortless and simple as possible, all the create pages
      follow the same order.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="table2">
    <h2>Offering Information</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <img src="Accommodation.png" alt="mockup" class ="offering" style="width:40%">
      <div class="info">
          Accommodation requires a lot of information such as location, photos, type of room, quantities,
          and more. For travellers to understand why the accommodation sleeps the amount of people
          it said it will, a quick drag and drop system is available for the provider to do so.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="table2">
    <h2>Cost</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <img src="Cost.png" alt="mockup" class ="cost" style="width:40%">
      <div class="info">
          Determining the cost of the offering was decided on having two options: fixed or custom.
          This allows the provider to easily determine how much they are charging. Once they finalize
          their cost, they can also see an overview of it to make sure that they didn’t make any mistakes.

  <div class="table2">
    <h2>Repeatability</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <img src="repeatability.png" alt="mockup" class ="repeatability" style="width:40%">
      <div class="info">
          An important part for providers is the repeatability of their offering. For them to easily
          indicate which days have offerings, that weekday is highlighted in red. When they touch it,
          it presents the start and end time of the offering and also allows them the option to add
          another offering. After, the providers are asked when their offering starts and ends with
          the scrollable menu from the bottom of the screen.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="table2">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <img src="overview.png" alt="mockup" class ="overview" style="width:40%">
      <div class="info">
          After all the repeatability steps, a calendar is set up so the provider can review when
          their offerings are and make sure that there are no errors. The red dot marks the first
          offering and the other colors mark the other offerings on that date.

  <div class="takeaways">
    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <p>
      Having the opportunity to work at a start up and have a flexible but fast paced environment really
      taught me how to manage time better. With a set deadline, it didn’t matter how I got it done and t
      his allowed me to manage work during work hours and outside work hours. Since it was a start up,
      the work done for me was close to none so me and my teammates had to start from scratch and
      work our way up from there.
