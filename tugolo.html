      <span style="color: #444444;font-size: 25px;font-weight: 100;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;">How
        can I connect these travellers with locals and help them experience real and authentic cultures?</span>
    <p>
      A new generation of Travelers are no longer interested in standard vacations. Instead, they
      want to get away from crowded areas to experience the real, authentic culture of the places
      they visit while seeing and doing things that only locals know about. However, travellers
      spend more time trying to book their trip than they will actually spend on vacation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Locals all across the globe can and want to provide the exact travel experiences that travelers are
      looking for. But the travelers and locals can’t find each other in a trusted way, and
      locals don't have the required tools to bring their trips to life and facilitate the
      transactions, and the business.

    <span style="color: #444444;font-size: 25px;font-weight: 100;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;">Introduce travellers to locals</span>
    <p>
      In order for travellers to connect with locals, the landing page had to showcase a variety of them and the
      possible services that they provide. The point of the landing page was to introduce travellers to locals
      rather than the experiences and accommodations.

      <p>
        Prototype 1 was based off of the original landing page with new features
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with this prototype was that it was advertised towards showcasing locations of the
        possible experiences

      <p>
        Decided to make the landing page that was unique and different.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with this prototype was it still didn’t satisfy Tugolo’s goal of connecting travellers to
        locals

    <h2>Landing Page Process</h2>
    <span style="color: #444444;font-size: 25px;font-weight: 100;font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;">How might we focus the traveller’s attention towards local’s profiles?</span>
    <p>
      For the landing page to match the criteria for the business, it had to be re-designed such that it
      advertised the locals so travellers can easily connect with them.
    </p>
    <img src="Tugolo_wireframe.png" alt="wireframe" class ="wireframe" style="width:65%">
    <p>
      First, the landing page needed to provide a quick access to the local’s profile and their offerings. The
      first wireframe presented the top friends of Tugolo but after some user testing, it was proven that it
      wasn’t enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second wireframe had a new addition called the best friends list. This allowed the landing page to
      not only provide its top friends but also its best friends for the traveller. With some user testing, it
      proved that it will grasp people’s attention more and will spend an extra couple seconds browsing it.

    <p>
      For Tugolo’s partners to register themselves, a simple interface is designed out for them to choose what
      kind of partner they want to be. After, it asks for their information and with the use of the horizontal
      scrolling menu, the partners can easily update it.

        <p>
          Once the partner chooses what category they fall into, it will ask for their personal information. Each
          page of information will slide up, following a new page of information. As a new page comes up,
          the horizontal scrolling menu slides accordingly.

    <p>
      Tugolo’s partners have many providers and friends and to bring those friends into the partner’s personal
      connections, a send out form was designed that presents two options; option 1 allows partners to send
      out the registration form to their providers and friends and option 2 allows partners to fill the registration
      form for them.

    <p>
      It is very important for partners to upload their offerings accurately. They need to list their experiences,
      accommodations, packages, and services. The amount of information needed for them to complete
      just one listing is substantial. To make it as effortless and simple as possible, all the create pages
      follow the same order.

        <p>
          Accommodation requires a lot of information such as location, photos, type of room, quantities,
          and more. For travellers to understand why the accommodation sleeps the amount of people
          it said it will, a quick drag and drop system is available for the provider to do so.

          Determining the cost of the offering was decided on having two options: fixed or custom.
          This allows the provider to easily determine how much they are charging. Once they finalize
          their cost, they can also see an overview of it to make sure that they didn’t make any mistakes.

        <h2>Repeatability</h2>
        <p>
          An important part for providers is the repeatability of their offering. For them to easily
          indicate which days have offerings, that weekday is highlighted in red. When they touch it,
          it presents the start and end time of the offering and also allows them the option to add
          another offering. After, the providers are asked when their offering starts and ends with
          the scrollable menu from the bottom of the screen.

            After all the repeatability steps, a calendar is set up so the provider can review when
            their offerings are and make sure that there are no errors. The red dot marks the first
            offering and the other colors mark the other offerings on that date.

    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <p>
      Having the opportunity to work at a start up with a flexible but fast paced environment really
      taught me how to manage time better. With a set deadline, it didn’t matter how I got it done and
      this allowed me to manage work during and outside work hours. Since it was a start up,
      the work done for me was close to none so my teammates and I had to start from scratch and
      build our way up from there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is ever finished. Learning this allowed me to design in a way that would be easily
      editable in the future. Altough my designs may be finished, there is always room for
      improvement and I learned that I had to set the future designer to continue what I started
      just through the designs.
