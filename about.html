      <h2>Hello...</h2>
      <p>
        Born in Seoul, South Korea and raised in Vancouver, Canada, I grew up as a
        curious individual seeking opportunities to portray my thoughts. I am currently
        enrolled in the program Global Business and Digital Arts at the University of Waterloo.
        I believe that this program has introduced me to many opportunities in
        the real world and a path where designing simply became a form of self-therapy.
      </p>

      <p>
        I worked at a start-up called Tugolo and re-designed their whole website
        and mobile pages. I found the joy of designing and creating a new interface,
        knowing that many people will benefit from it. Tugolo was a special experience because I got
        to step my foot into the travel industry. I learned so much and wish to pursue
        this industry in the near future again to satisfy my passion for travelling.
      </p>
        Following up with my peers, I am continously learning more as a designer and strive to further
        grasp a deeper understanding in this industry.
